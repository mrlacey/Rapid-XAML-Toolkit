Microsoft.WebTools.Languages.Json.dll is originally from C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\Extensions\Microsoft\Web Tools\Languages
It is an internal library for Visual Studio and not officially for use as there is no guarantee of API stability.
It is included here as it provides the IJsonSchemaSelector interface.
Without a copy directly accessible it's not possible to build the project outside of VS (such as is needed by AppVeyor and GitHub Actions)
