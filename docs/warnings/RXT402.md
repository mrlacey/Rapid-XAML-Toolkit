# RXT402

Use `MediaPlayerElement` in place of `MediaElement`.

Applies to **UWP** only!

## Description

You are using the `MediaElement` when you could be using `MediaPlayerElement`.

## Why this is suggested

It is recommend that you use `MediaPlayerElement` in place of `MediaElement`. `MediaPlayerElement` has the same functionality as `MediaElement`, while also enabling more advanced media playback scenarios. Additionally, all future improvements in media playback will happen in `MediaPlayerElement`.

## How to address the issue

Press `Crtl + .` and use the suggested action 'Change to MediaPlayerElement.'
This will change the element being used.

After changing the element you should double-check that all functionality still works as expected.
