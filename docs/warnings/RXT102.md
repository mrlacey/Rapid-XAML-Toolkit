# RXT102

Use of a `Grid.Column` value without corresponding `ColumnDefinition`.

## Description

A column has been assigned that hasn't been defined.

In the example below, only 2 columns have been defined but the `TextBlock` has been assigned to the fourth column. (Remember that assigned row numbers start with zero.)

```xml
<Grid>
    <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
        <ColumnDefinition Width="*">
        <ColumnDefinition Width="*">
    </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>

    <TextBlock
        Text="Hello World"
        Grid.Column="3">
</Grid>
```

## Why this is suggested

The use of undefined columns can lead to unexpected layout behavior.
It can also be confusing for other people looking at the code.

## How to address the issue

Press `Ctrl + .` and use the suggested action 'Add missing column definitions.'
This will add column definitions for what has been assigned.
If no column definitions are currently assigned then a `Grid.ColumnDefinitions` element will be added. If there are already some column definitions defined, additional ones will be added at the end.

After additional column definitions have been added, you may need to adjust their widths according to your need.
