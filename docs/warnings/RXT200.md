# RXT200

Use of hard-coded string.

Currently, applies to **UWP** only!

## Description

The document contains a hard-coded string value that will not be localized.

## Why this is suggested

Do not use hard-coded values. Use a localized resource instead.

A localized app allows your users to use it in the language of their choosing or preference.

For assistance in automating the translation of text in your app consider using the [Multilingual App Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/globalizing/use-mat).

## How to address the issue

Press `Crtl + .` on the element and use the suggested action 'Move hard-coded string to resource file.'
Alternatively, right-click on the document and select 'Rapid XAML' &gt; 'Move all hard-coded strings to Resource file'.

If the element does not have an `x:Uid` property defined, one will be added to the element as this is needed to add the localized string at runtime.
