# RXT350

`Image` lacks accessibility consideration.

## Description

An `Image` has been added to the document but has no information available to accessibility tools to describe what it represents.

## Why this is suggested

People may use your app who are unable to view or understand the image. Adding some text that can be read by a screen-reader is a simple step you can do to make your app more inclusive.
This is useful if the image contains content that is relevant or important to the user.
If the image element does not include useful or relevant content (such as if it's used for a background,) it should be excluded from what is exposed to accessibility tools.

## How to address the issue

Press `Crtl + .` and use the suggested action 'Add automation description' or 'Exclude from accessible view.'

If adding a description, ensure you provide a suitable name or description for the image and test with a screen-reader or similar tool.
