# RXT601

`TextBox` does not have a name that can be used by accessibility tooling.

## Description

All focusable elements (including `TextBox`) must have a name that accessibility tools can use to concisely and meaningfully identify the element.

## Why this is suggested

The Name of a focusable element must not be null.

Provide a UI Automation Name property that concisely identifies the element. This can be `Name`, `x:Name`, `Header`, `AutomationProperties.Name`, or `AutomationProperties.LabeledBy`.

## How to address the issue

Press `Ctrl + .` and use the suggested action 'Add automation name.'

Adjust the default value added based on what is appropriate for your app.
