# Features

Make working with XAML files faster and easier with these great features. Whether you're starting with a ViewModel and an empty view, or already have XAML written, there are features here to help all developers.

## XAML Generation

Drag the ViewModel file onto the open XAML source file.

Get the XAML from the ViewModel and paste it into the View.

You don't have to copy the XAML for the whole class.

If you want to add the XAML in multiple places you can send them to the Toolbox and use them from there.

## XAML Analysis

A number of potential issues will be listed in the Error List and underlined in source. Suggested Actions are also included to help address each issue.

The image below shows some of the issues that analysis can find (and fix).

- Right-click on an opening `Grid` tag and easily add Row and Column definitions.
